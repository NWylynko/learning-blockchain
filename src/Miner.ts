    // "mining" is basically getting a computer to guess the solution to a puzzle

    // by setting the length of the 0000 to longer eg 000000 it increases the difficulty
    // bitcoin re-calculates the length of 0s every 2 weeks or so to keep the average length of mining to 10 minutes
    // while other cryptocurrencies have shorter lengths

    // the purpose of this is that it stops malicious actors from inserting transactions into the chain
    // this only works if the mining network is distributed and no one owns more than 50% of the nodes

    // it starts at 1 and goes up until the first 4 characters in the attempt are 0000 (im not sure whats special about that)
    // i think this needs to be changed to generate a random number and check
      // otherwise a malicious actor could put there own blocks in if they have the fastest computer
      // as on average they will be-able to generate the solution faster than any competition
      // where if the solution is random than the majority of miners will be able to get the solution on average faster
    // once it gets the solutions (what needs to be added the nonce for the hex representation to start with 0000)
    // it returns the solution
    // this can then be checked very easily by taking the nonce and solution and verifiying the first four digits are 0000

    // the first minor to guess the solution wins 1 of the coin as a reward
    // the solution needs to be stored with the block
    // the miners need there own wallet and add there public key to the block if they are successful to claim the coin
